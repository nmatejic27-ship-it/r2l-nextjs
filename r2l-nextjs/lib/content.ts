    q: '"I don\'t have enough time."',
    a: "Your program is designed around your actual schedule — not some ideal fantasy week. Whether you have 3 hours or 8 hours per week to train, we build something that fits your life. Most busy clients see their best results because they stop wasting time on random workouts and follow a focused, efficient plan.",
  },
  {
    q: '"I\'ve tried things before and quit. What makes this different?"',
    a: "Quitting happens when there's no accountability and the plan isn't built for you. This program solves both. You have a real coach checking in on you, who adjusts your plan when life happens, and who makes it genuinely difficult to disappear. The consistency that felt impossible before becomes structured and automatic.",

  {
    q: '"I\'m afraid of failing again."',
    a: "That fear is understandable and it's exactly why having a coach matters. You're not doing this alone. When you feel like quitting, your coach is there. When something isn't working, we fix it. The risk of failure drops dramatically when someone has skin in the game alongside you.",
  },
  {
    q: '"I have an injury or physical limitations."',
    a: "All programs are built around what your body can actually do. If you have injuries or limitations, we work around them — not through them. The application process captures all of this so your program is designed for the real you, not an assumption of you.",
  },
  {
    q: '"I\'m not in shape enough to start coaching."',
    a: "This is one of the most common things we hear — and it's backwards. The whole point of coaching is to meet you exactly where you are. You don't need to get ready to start. Starting is how you get ready. Every client starts from a different point. The program adapts to yours.",

  {
    q: '"Is this actually worth $99/month?"',
    a: "Compare it to what you've already spent — gym memberships you stopped using, programs you abandoned, food you ate that didn't serve your goals. This is less than $4 a day for a completely custom plan, weekly expert adjustments, direct coach access, and the accountability system that actually makes it stick. The question is: what does staying where you are cost you?",
